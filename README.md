# Orbital Descent - My Interactive Story Game

Hey everyone!!!! This is my SUPER COOL sci-fi game that I made for my coding class. It was a real challenge cause we were only allowed to use ONE file for the entire project!! That means all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript had to go in the same place which was crazy hard but I think it turned out pretty good?? 

## About the Game

I spent like FOREVER writing the story lol. I wanted to make something with space and danger and cool choices. Coming up with all the different endings was the hardest part cause I had to make sure everything connected and made sense. My teacher said we needed at least 3 endings but I went overboard and made 7!!! I was up til like 2am some nights working on this (don't tell my parents haha).

The story is about being on a space station that's falling out of orbit and you have to make choices to either save yourself, save others, or try to save the station. Some of the technical stuff might not be 100% accurate but whatever, it's sci-fi!!

## How to Play

1. Just open the HTML file in any browser
2. Click START MISSION to begin
3. Read the story and make choices by clicking buttons
4. Try to survive!!!!
5. Play again to find all 7 endings!

## Known Bugs (oops)

Theres only one bug I know about. The game doesnt show up correctly on mobile phones. The text gets all weird and some buttons might not show up right. To fix it you just need to activate desktop mode in your phone's browser. I tried to fix it but CSS is SO ANNOYING sometimes and I ran out of time before the project was due.

I might fix it later if I have time after finals are over.
