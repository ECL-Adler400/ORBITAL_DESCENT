# Orbital Descent - My Interactive Story Game

This is my 1 FILE Coding Challenge .

## About the Game

I spent like FOREVER writing the story.

The story is about being on a space station that's falling out of orbit and you have to make choices to either save yourself, save others, or try to save the station. Some of the technical stuff might not be 100% accurate but idc.

## How to Play

1. Just open the HTML file in any browser
2. Or Click this link -->

4. Click START MISSION to begin
5. Read the story and make choices by clicking buttons
6. Try to survive!!!!
7. Play again to find all 7 endings!

## Known Bugs 

Theres only one bug I know about. The game doesnt show up correctly on mobile phones. The text gets all weird and some buttons might not show up right. To fix it you just need to activate desktop mode in your phone's browser. I tried to fix it but CSS is SO ANNOYING sometimes and I ran out of time before the project was due.

I might fix it later if I have time after finals are over.
